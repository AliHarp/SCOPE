    "text": "The paper “Mapping Applications of Computer Simulation in Orthopedic Services: A Topic Modeling Approach” has been submitted to the Winter Simulation Conference, 2025 (Seattle) under the Health & Life Sciences Track.\nOrthopedic health services are characterized by high patient volumes, long elective waits, unpredictable emergency demand, and close coupling with other hospital processes. These present significant challenges for meeting operational targets and maintaining quality of care. In healthcare, simulation has been widely used for addressing such challenges. Topic modeling is used to identify and analyze academic papers using simulation to address operational-level challenges for orthopedic service delivery. We analyzed 37 papers over twenty years, combining a structured analysis with topic modeling to categorize and map applications. Despite widespread recognition of its potential, simulation remains underutilized in orthopedics, with fragmented application and limited real-world implementation. Recent trends indicate a shift toward system-wide approaches that better align with operational realities and stakeholder needs. Future research should aim to bridge methodological innovation with collaboration and practical application, such as hybrid and real-time simulation approaches focusing on stakeholder needs, and integrating relevant operational performance metrics.\nThe study aims to investigate how simulation has been used to support operational-level service planning in trauma and orthopedic services. The purpose of the study is to understand the current state-of-the-art, and to identify research gaps and opportunities to strengthen the implementation of simulation for orthopedic service planning. The specific aims are:",

    "text": "Orthopaedic elective waiting lists are a well-publicized NHS challenge. While currently at record waits, this problem is not new, and one contributing factor is the need to simultaneously manage unpredictable emergency arrivals with scheduled elective care.\n\n\n\n\nDiscrete-event simulation (DES) is a computational method used to model complex queuing systems, enabling experimentation with the model instead of the real system. Previous work has modelled elective orthopaedic services, but not both elective and emergency care, nor accounted for additional complexity, such as a deteriorating physical condition. This is methodologically challenging using DES alone.\nIn this project, agent-based simulation and DES will be integrated to combine the strengths of the two methods, creating a more robust simulation that better captures system complexities. We will provide a bespoke user-interface for our NHS partners, enabling experimentation with the model. This will include transferring more complex patients to SWAOC, and modelling winter pressures.\nUsing Python, we will take a best practice open science approach, ensuring model transparency, reproducibility, and longevity. We will investigate reusability of hybrid model components for wider NHS planning. Our scoping work and prototype model will inform an ESRC New Investigator grant.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
