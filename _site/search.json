    "section": "",
    "text": "The paper “Mapping Applications of Computer Simulation in Orthopedic Services: A Topic Modeling Approach” has been submitted to the Winter Simulation Conference, 2025 (Seattle) under the Health & Life Sciences Track.\nOrthopaedic health services are characterised by high patient volumes, long elective waits, unpredictable emergency demand, and close coupling with other hospital processes. These present significant challenges for meeting operational targets and maintaining quality of care. In healthcare, simulation has been widely used for addressing such challenges. Topic modelling is used to identify and analyse academic papers using simulation to address operational-level challenges for orthopaedic service delivery. We analyzed 37 papers over twenty years, combining a structured analysis with topic modelling to categorize and map applications. Despite widespread recognition of its potential, simulation remains underutilised in orthopaedics, with fragmented application and limited real-world implementation. Recent trends indicate a shift toward system-wide approaches that better align with operational realities and stakeholder needs. Future research should aim to bridge methodological innovation with collaboration and practical application, such as hybrid and real-time simulation approaches focusing on stakeholder needs, and integrating relevant operational performance metrics.\nThe study aims to investigate how simulation has been used to support operational-level service planning in trauma and orthopedic services. The purpose of the study is to understand the current state-of-the-art, and to identify research gaps and opportunities to strengthen the implementation of simulation for orthopedic service planning. The specific aims are:\n\nTo identify studies that have used simulation methods for evaluating orthopedic service delivery;\nTo investigate methods, application areas, context of care, key performance indicators, and outcomes;\nTo classify papers by topics, and map the application domain focusing on future opportunities.\n\n\nWe use a structured full-text analysis combined with topic modeling to analyze and synthesize the literature. Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique that identifies underlying themes or topics in large text datasets by grouping related words and concepts. It was conducted to supplement the structured analysis by revealing latent themes and relationships within the literature. Examining relationships between topics and the structured analysis can help identify emerging trends and gaps in the existing body of knowledge. Given the small size of our dataset, the structured analysis enhances topic coherence and interpretability, while topic modeling adds a systematic and reproducible layer of abstraction that uncovers patterns and relationships in the literature with greater rigor than manual review alone. Topic modelling was performed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), implemented via Gibbs sampling in R v4.4.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRISMA-compliant workflow: Haddaway NR, Page MJ, Pritchard CC, McGuinness LA.

    "text": "Orthopaedic elective waiting lists are a well-publicized NHS challenge. While currently at record waits, this problem is not new, and one contributing factor is the need to simultaneously manage unpredictable emergency arrivals with scheduled elective care.\n\n\n\n\nDiscrete-event simulation (DES) is a computational method used to model complex queuing systems, enabling experimentation with the model instead of the real system. Previous work has modelled elective orthopaedic services, but not both elective and emergency care, nor accounted for additional complexity, such as a deteriorating physical condition. This is methodologically challenging using DES alone.\nIn this project, agent-based simulation and DES will be integrated to combine the strengths of the two methods, creating a more robust simulation that better captures system complexities. We will provide a bespoke user-interface for our NHS partners, enabling experimentation with the model. This will include transferring more complex patients to SWAOC, and modelling winter pressures.\nUsing Python, we will take a best practice open science approach, ensuring model transparency, reproducibility, and longevity. We will investigate reusability of hybrid model components for wider NHS planning. Our scoping work and prototype model will inform an ESRC New Investigator grant.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
